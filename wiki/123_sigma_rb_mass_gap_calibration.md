# 123 — σ_RB Mass-Gap Calibration: Three Sigmas, and What Does Not Conflate

| | |
|---|---|
| Scope | a cross-test of `bao_mass_gap.py` against `oblique_gear_test.py`: the three objects named σ in the codebase; Δ fed into σ_RB's tilt; the strut-blindness of σ_self; a T7 mean-sensitivity anomaly; the "rectifier law" |
| Measured | 2026-09-23; continues [75b](75b_bao_mass_gap_engine.md), [14](14_redblue_hamiltonian.md), [25](25_sedenion_manual.md) |
| Code | `ValaQuenta/bao_mass_gap.py`; `ContextPlease/claude/scratchpad/2026-08-31_oblique-gear/oblique_gear_test.py` (`sigma_rb`, `tilt_axis`, `p_red_blue`, `sigma_self`) and `ANOMALY_CHASE.md` |
| Confidence | the algebra of strut-blindness and the rectifier law: ESTABLISHED (re-derived and re-run, Listing 1) · **one number of the 2026-09-23 record does not reproduce** (§2) · T7: OPEN |
| Last verified | 2026-11-13: Listing 1 executed; the formulas of `sigma_rb`, `p_red_blue` and `sigma_self` were read from the source; the T7 drift runs were not repeated |

## 1. The problem this page exists to prevent

"σ" names three different objects in the codebase; each is correct in its own file, and the risk is carrying a result from one into a sentence about another ([85](85_the_apex_path.md) §8 tabulates the wider collision):

| Name | Where | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| **σ_ζ** | `ValaQuenta/modules/h_rb_hat/maths.py`, `sigma` parameter | Re(s), the Dirichlet/Euler coupling exponent; a single float. Facets 0, ½, 1, 2, real-only ([14](14_redblue_hamiltonian.md) §4). **No string/M-theory facet at this level.** |
| **σ-strata** | [25](25_sedenion_manual.md) §IX, σ₀ … σ₄ | ordinal nested-inclusion levels of the sedenion (how many of the 16 components are switched on); not a continuous exponent. σ₄ = all 16 active, "String / ground state" |
| **σ_RB** | `oblique_gear_test.py` | σ_RB[k] = ψ[k]·conj(ψ[k⊕4]), ψ ∈ ℂ¹⁶; tilt = Re (an 8-vector, driven), axis = Im (an 8-vector, the conserved anchor). `σ_self` (red/(red + blue), the code's name) is a separate derived scalar built from σ_RB |

Where "mass gap → string theory" already lives: [25](25_sedenion_manual.md) §VII at the σ-strata level, **not** the other two: GAP = the e₁₅ component → the zero-divisor boundary → 7 imaginary octonion units → G₂ holonomy → 11D = 4 observable + 7 compact → M-theory, one vacuum; the same chain (11 = 4 + 7, G₂ = Aut 𝕆) as `bao_mass_gap/maths.py`'s `mtheory_compactification()`. It is a compactification-scale argument (Δ sets a geometric scale), not a σ-facet assignment. The module's own docstring makes the stronger claims "GAP eliminates the string landscape (10⁵⁰⁰ → 1 vacuum)" and "GAP ≈ 1/(1000√2) (the identity holds to 3 significant figures)"; the first is the framework's reading and the second is the 0.035 % agreement of [120](120_symmetry_breaking_is_the_instrument.md) §5.

## 2. The calibration test  `ESTABLISHED` (algebra), one number corrected

Forward propagation, not derivation: Δ = 0.000707357533 (`bao_mass_gap.py`'s residue Ω_ζΣ − D\*·ln 10, with D\* = 0.246; Listing 1 reproduces 0.000707357533) is typed into σ_RB's real part as the mean tilt across all 8 struts; what is tested is whether the machinery accepts it and what it does. Re(σ_RB) = tilt = Δ on all 8 struts by construction (the input, not a finding).

**σ_self is strut-blind** once each pair's energy is held fixed at a constant E. From the source: `red = Σₖ|ψ[k] + ψ[k⊕4]|²/2`, `blue = Σₖ|ψ[k] − ψ[k⊕4]|²/2` over the 8 pair representatives, so red − blue = 2Σ Re(ψ[k]·conj ψ[k⊕4]) = 2 Σ tilt and red + blue = Σ|ψ|². With each pair's energy |ψ[k]|² + |ψ[k⊕4]|² = E, red + blue = 8E and red = 4E + Σtilt, hence

```
σ_self = ½ + Σtilt/(8E) = ½ + mean(tilt)/E = ½ + Δ/E
```

independent of how the tilt is distributed across the struts (exact algebra). Listing 1 builds three different strut distributions with the same mean Δ and the same pair energy E = 1 and reads σ_self from `red/(red + blue)`: all three give **0.500707357533** (= ½ + Δ). That lands deep in the **σ_ζ = ½ (Quantum Mechanics / Riemann)** facet, nowhere near string theory: the string/M-theory route belongs to the σ-strata / compactification mechanism above and does not emerge from feeding Δ into σ_RB's tilt; the two should not be merged into one claim.

**A number that does not reproduce.** The 2026-09-23 record gives σ_self = 0.500707357179 at E = 1 and says it was "verified to 12 digits". The arithmetic above gives ½ + Δ = 0.500707357533, a difference of 3.5×10⁻¹⁰ at the tenth digit; the algebra and Listing 1 agree with each other and not with the recorded digits. The cause was not located (a different D\*/Ω value or an embedding detail in the original run are candidates); the qualitative result (strut-blind, σ_self = ½ + Δ/E) is unaffected, and the recorded "12 digits" is not reproduced.

## 3. The rectifier law  `ESTABLISHED` (derived)

An energy-unnormalised embedding, ψ[k] = ψ[k⊕4] = √|tilt_k| (signed so that the tilt is reproduced), let strut information leak into σ_self; flagged under the chase-every-anomaly discipline and resolved to an exact law. Derivation: for a pair with tilt tₖ > 0, a = b = √tₖ gives |a + b|²/2 = 2tₖ to red and nothing to blue; for tₖ < 0, a = −b gives 2|tₖ| to blue; so red = 2Σ_{t>0} t, blue = 2Σ_{t<0}|t|, red + blue = 2Σ|tₖ|, and with Σtₖ = 8Δ:

```
σ_self = ½ + 4Δ / Σₖ |Δ + λ·uₖ|        (tₖ = Δ + λ uₖ, u a fixed unit strut direction, λ the strut scale)
```

Two regimes (Listing 1): below the first sign-flip threshold all tₖ share Δ's sign, blue = 0 and **σ_self = 1.0 exactly**, flat (the struts are invisible); above threshold the deviation σ_self − ½ falls as an **inverse first power** of λ (log–log slope −1.00 over λ = 10²…10⁵; the record's −0.9985), matching the closed form's large-λ asymptote 4Δ/(λΣ|uₖ|); inverse-square is ruled out.

## 4. A real correction, filed against T7  `OPEN`

`oblique_gear_test.py`'s T7 docstring claims drift tracks the 7 tilt struts only ("the axis holds, mean doesn't matter"). Measured otherwise on the 2026-09-23 run (not repeated here): same struts, three means, a 200-step gain = 0.05 gear-train run: drift 3.6640 (mean Δ), 3.9194 (mean 0), 3.9303 (mean −Δ): the mean moves the drift, asymmetrically in ±Δ and outside an 8-sample same-scale control's spread (0.006–0.04). **Open**: not yet distinguished from the ordinary chaotic sensitivity of a 200-step nonlinear iterated rotation against a genuinely Δ-specific effect; it needs many more trials or a local-sensitivity (Lyapunov) measurement. Background: `ANOMALY_CHASE.md` (the balanced-ψ drift is a growth from a 10⁻¹⁶ residual at rate λ ≈ 5.9–6.1 per unit flow time, the hyperbolic saddle of [110](110_qm_in_gr_gr_in_qm.md) §5).

## 5. Status

**OPEN / THEORETICAL.** An ad hoc cross-test between two existing scripts; neither is wired into ValaQuenta's `EquationModule`/engine formulary, so nothing here earns `:CALCULATED` (that suffix requires the machinery to reproduce a result from its own construction, not accept an injected input unchanged). **Solid:** the strut-blindness of σ_self (exact algebra, re-run); the rectifier's inverse-first-power law (exact derivation, re-run). **Open:** whether T7's mean-sensitivity is Δ-specific or generic chaotic noise; whether σ_RB has any principled, non-injected route to *producing* Δ rather than accepting it without contradiction. **Corrected:** the recorded digits 0.500707357179 (§2).
