# 95 — The Scale: Decompositional Analysis, Forwards and Backwards

| | |
|---|---|
| Scope | SCALE (identity 1, gain 1, axis {×, /}) extracted from a quantity in both directions; what stays invariant at each of three levels; the master identity Γ = tanh(½ ln(Z/Z₀)); the ASS datatype; "locally square"; the J_red/J_blue "two rings" pairing that turned out to be one number; the speculative connections |
| Written | 2026-08-25; the author: "this is why it's the primary forensic tool of the generational lineage engine … This is The Scale … the scale invariant/scale blind version of the maths" and, correcting the scope, "the purpose of this engine is for decompositional analysis … so forwards and backwards" |
| Continues | the same-day VAPMIP thread (Vigenère quaternion, Enigma octonion, the two-ring/Smith-chart Möbius fold) and [92](92_ring_theory_spine.md) |
| Code | `ValaQuenta/modules/scale/` (`maths.py`, `tools.py`, `EquationModule` contract); `modules/add_scale_sign/` (`ASS`, `ASSWord`); notebook `17_scale.ipynb`; `ValaQuenta/wiki/scale.md`; `GenerationalLineage/engine/lineage.py` PW13–PW15 (the first proof; the ValaQuenta module is an independent port) |
| Confidence | the identities, the cross-ratio invariance, the derivative and the Möbius/matrix statements: ESTABLISHED (re-run) · the ASS datatype and the "defined twice" defect: a design, `THEORETICAL` · the "witches hat into a galaxy", gravastar and thermal-ceiling remarks: speculative, recorded as such |
| Last verified | 2026-11-13: Listing 1 executed; its output is quoted below. The ASS module and the five custom-ring tests of `scale.md` §8 were not re-run |

## 1. Where SCALE already lived

The generational-lineage skill (§1) names three tier-0 irreducibles: ADD, SCALE, SIGN. SCALE was never a new concept; what was missing was an instrument that extracts it from a quantity and names what remains, in both directions.

## 2. One statement, three levels, three different answers

> An object's scale can always be extracted, but what remains invariant depends on the level at which the question is asked, and the levels do not share an answer.

**Level 1: one point, polar decompose/recompose (exact).** Z = r e^{iθ}; r = |Z| is the scale (real, non-negative, ordinal); θ = arg Z is scale-blind under real-positive rescaling, arg(λZ) = arg Z for λ > 0, exactly. The return path is exact: `polar_recompose(*polar_decompose(Z)) == Z` to < 10⁻⁹ over five test points (a near-zero and a near-million magnitude included).

**Level 2: the two-ring/Möbius fold, a different and harder question.** With the Smith-chart fold Γ = (Z − Z₀)/(Z + Z₀), is θ still the scale-blind invariant? **No**, and the rejected candidate is kept: the fold's fixed point is Z₀, not the origin, so rescaling about 0 is not a symmetry of the fold. Listing 1: for Z = λ(1 + i) with anchor Z₀ = 1, arg Γ = 2.0344, 1.1071, 0.2013, 0.0200 at λ = 0.5, 1, 5, 50 while arg(λZ) stays 0.7854. (The page quoted a range 1.054 → 0.007 for a test point it does not state; the pattern, a steep fall with λ, is the same.) The actual invariant at this level is the **cross-ratio** of four points, the classical Möbius invariant: folding the same four points through the fold at four different anchors (one nearly on the pole) leaves the cross-ratio unchanged (differences 0.0 in Listing 1). It is a property of a relationship among four points and not of any one.

**Level 3: a whole process, pathway decomposition.** `pathway_decompose()` runs a dependency graph of named operators, not a forced linear chain. Control case: real RSA CRT-decrypt (p = 61, q = 53): m₁ and m₂ are siblings (each depends only on the ciphertext), h depends on both, and the final message depends on h **and** m₂ again, a fan-out that a linear chain cannot represent. Forwards is running the graph; backwards is whatever the architecture provides, and the module does not manufacture a return path a process does not have.

## 3. Why a caustic was checked, and rejected  `ESTABLISHED`

A crowding of circles near the Smith chart's boundary invites the word "caustic". The exact derivative dΓ/dZ = 2Z₀/(Z + Z₀)² is never zero for finite Z (Listing 1: its minimum over |Z| = 10⁻³ … 10⁶ is 2×10⁻¹², tending to zero only as |Z| → ∞), and diverges only at the isolated pole Z = −Z₀. A caustic needs a vanishing Jacobian (an envelope); crowding toward infinity at one point is a different phenomenon, and the project does not conflate them.

## 4. What this is not claiming

- "Ring" as a family of circles on the Smith chart is not the "ring" of abstract algebra. Möbius transformations under composition form a group, the group of units of the matrix ring M₂(ℂ): composition equals matrix multiplication (Listing 1: difference 0.0), real but one level underneath, and only the multiplicative half is used when chaining folds.
- Not every process has a clean backward pass. RSA and the Vigenère cipher do; the module reports what the dependency graph contains.

## 5. The master identity  `ESTABLISHED`

The author: "The Scale (log and exponents) are unfolding and folding pretty directly right?" Checked, not agreed with on the spot: **Γ = tanh(½ ln(Z/Z₀))**, exactly, for complex Z and Z₀ (Listing 1: maximum difference 2×10⁻¹² over 20,000 random complex pairs with the principal logarithm, so the identity holds up to the branch of the log). Folding is log-then-bound; unfolding is unbound-then-exp, Z = Z₀ exp(2 artanh Γ).

```

## 6. The datatype and the generalised equation (2026-08-28)  `THEORETICAL`

The fold Γ = tanh(½u) is the generating function of Aff(1, ℝ) acting on ln x. Every framework quantity is a **word** in the tier-0 generators {ADD, SCALE, SIGN}, anchored on a d\* face:

```
u = Σₖ [ gₖ ln sₖ + aₖ ]      Γ = tanh(u/2)
          SIGN  SCALE   ADD
GROUND STATE   aₖ → 0, sₖ → 1, gₖ → +1  ⇒  u = 0  ⇒  Γ = 0  ⇒  x = the anchor
               = the now / the viewport / SCALE at identity = "readiness = ground state = only ADD:SCALE:SIGN"
```

It is said to cover the constant placements, Σ_RB (the composite ADD:SCALE:SIGN lineage, 2·ADD / 3·SCALE / 4·SIGN), the Penrose {4:8:4} (past/now/future = ADD/SCALE/SIGN), the curriculum (one word, out and back) and the error check (the residual between two anchor faces); it **closes** iff d\*_RG (the Stability face) gets a closed form, the depth → ∞ fixed point of "fold the fold", currently OPEN ([17](17_alpha_omega_d_star.md)). Built as a value type, `ValaQuenta/modules/add_scale_sign/` (`ASS`, `ASSWord`): compose with `@`, invert with `~`, take
residuals, decompose into an `ASSWord` in two orderings (chrono / zeta), read out on orthogonal Smith charts; firing order is the three-phase camshaft SIGN → SCALE → ADD, and the firing defect (g − 1) ln s is non-zero exactly when the SIGN flips a non-trivial SCALE ("defined twice", the same shape as the Bell composed-rotation defect). Whether the listed quantities all *are* words of this form is the design claim; the identity of §5 is what is established.

## 7. "Locally square"  `ESTABLISHED`

At any point the two ring-directions' tangent vectors are equal in length and 90° apart (Listing 1: 0.588235 and 0.588235 at 90.0000°), for any choice of what the two rings mean: a consequence of the fold being holomorphic in Z (conformal), independent of what the caller assigned to ring₁ and ring₂. Every curvilinear cell of the chart is locally a square by construction, before any physical interpretation.

## 8. User-defined rings, and the pairing that turned out to be fake

`custom_ring_chart` takes any two functions of any object. Five proposed pairs were tested on real data (numbers in `ValaQuenta/wiki/scale.md` §8; not re-run). The one worth repeating: **J_red and J_blue are not two independent rings.** The recorded finding is "J_red + J_blue = 1.0000000000 on every real sentence tried", because the encoder returns a unit-normalised vector split into two non-overlapping halves. Precisely, it is the **squared** norms of the two halves that sum to 1 (Listing 1: 1.000000000000, while the half-norms sum to 1.3789): what looked like two rings is
one number (σ_self) under two labels. The two-independent-ring version pairs σ_self against J_green (the su(2) bracket quantity, [J_blue, J_red] = J_green); note the sign/bracket issues of [70](70_precession_stroke_oblique_crank_trine.md) §4 before building it. This is what testing a "what if" is for: catching the one pairing that looked plausible and was not.

## 9. What is speculative, stated as speculative

- **"Witches hat into a galaxy."** The Higgs/Mexican-hat potential (an unstable symmetric maximum ringed by a trough of degenerate vacua) resembles the fold's singular centre Z₀ surrounded by a continuum; inflationary models do use a hat-shaped scalar potential to seed density fluctuations. The shape resemblance is real; the identification of the two objects is not shown.
- **"Black hole unwrapping into a white-hole gravastar before evaporation and BANG."** Gravastars and black-hole-to-white-hole bounce models are published, non-mainstream proposals; the fold's isolated pole (Z = −Z₀, verified in Listing 1) is a mathematical fact the image evokes, not evidence that the physics is right.
- **"Between causality and the informational thermal ceiling, even this tool loses resolution"** is a closing limit, not a new claim: the project's named boundary for that idea is d\* ([17](17_alpha_omega_d_star.md)), and any instrument built on the fold inherits it.
