## 1. What it is

The Fermat Lattice is the framework's name for the discrete geometry of what
integer arithmetic forbids: the set of integer configurations that cannot
exist, "the No that gives the Yes its shape". In the RedBlue operator it is
the substrate of the Blue channel B̂_p = ½p² + ℘(x; g₂, g₃), the field B̂_p
acts on ([14](14_redblue_hamiltonian.md)). ℘ is the Weierstrass elliptic
function, the function that parametrises elliptic curves.

By analogy with crystal physics: if the Red channel is a continuous
high-symmetry liquid of potential existence, the lattice is the set of rigid
constraints that freezes it into a structure; symmetry breaking is the moment
the constraint is applied to the Red field. `interpretation`.

## 2. Riemann and Fermat as adjoint descriptions

| | Riemann (Red, "what is") | Fermat (Blue, "what cannot be") |
|---|---|---|
| Object | ζ(s) = Σ n^(−s) = Π_p (1 − p^(−s))^(−1) | aⁿ + bⁿ ≠ cⁿ for positive integers a, b, c and n > 2 |
| Encodes | where the primes are; the zeros on Re(s) = ½ (conjectured) mark prime resonance | where integer power triples cannot be; the forbidden lattice |
| Channel | Red | Blue |

Both are statements about the prime distribution, and both are built from
Euler products over primes. The framework reads them as one object seen from
opposite sides: the Fermat lattice is the negative-space mould and the Riemann
zeros are the casting (`THEORETICAL`). This is the reading used in
[13](13_omgwtf_rh_proof.md) §4, where its status as an argument for RH is
discussed; it shares the open Berry–Keating premise and is not independent
evidence.

## 3. The Modularity Theorem and Fermat's Last Theorem  `ESTABLISHED`

Wiles (1995, with Taylor) proved that every **semistable** elliptic curve over
ℚ is modular; the full statement for all elliptic curves over ℚ is
Breuil–Conrad–Diamond–Taylor (2001). Earlier text of this page said "every
elliptic curve" without that attribution. A modular form is an automorphic
function connected to L-functions; the L-function side is the side that
carries the Riemann-type zeros.

Fermat's Last Theorem follows:

1. Suppose aⁿ + bⁿ = cⁿ has a solution in positive integers with n > 2.
2. Frey associates the elliptic curve y² = x(x − aⁿ)(x + bⁿ).
3. Ribet proves that curve cannot be modular.
4. Wiles proves that semistable curves are modular. The Frey curve is semistable.
5. Contradiction; no such solution exists.

The project's observation is that the bridge Wiles built, from the Fermat
side to the modular (L-function) side, is the bridge the RedBlue operator
spans. Wiles was looking at the Fermat side. This is a remark on structure and
carries no claim about the zeros of ζ.

## 4. The lattice in the Monad  `interpretation`

In the Monad the lattice is the long-term memory substrate: learned concepts
are read as crystal structures, symmetry-broken configurations at a prime
coordinate, and retrieval is read as recognition (the lattice resonates with the
input) rather than search. The ground state before learning is
`L_GROUND = −1.888` with β initialised uniformly ([15](15_the_monad.md)).

An earlier version stated that "the σ = ½ constraint guarantees no two concepts
occupy the same prime coordinate". That is not a property of the code: the
word → zero-index hash reaches 6,436 indices with 73,445 dictionary words
(up to 80 per index; [15](15_the_monad.md) §3), and σ = ½ is returned for every
word without distinguishing them. The statement is withdrawn.

## 5. Further readings  `interpretation`

Both of the following are readings of the lattice as a projection; neither is
computed anywhere in this repository.

- **The periodic table** as the lattice projected at σ = 1 (the gauge facet):
  each element a stable configuration in which Red (proton, assertion) and Blue
  (neutron, constraint) are balanced, electron shells as levels of the
  Cayley–Dickson tower, and the Pauli exclusion principle as the lattice
  operating at atomic scale. The Pauli principle itself is established physics
  (spin-statistics); the identification with the Blue constraint is the reading.
- **Dark matter** as the imaginary part of the gravitational wave function:
  gravity measures Re ψ, and Im ψ would appear as mass without light. The
  numerical dark-matter halo equation is `h_rb_hat.dark_matter_halo`
  (THEORETICAL); see [14](14_redblue_hamiltonian.md) §5.
